Avoid rounding your back during this exercise as it not only strains the back, but cheats your chest muscles from doing the work. Keep your back flat on the bench. Choose heavier weights for a decline bench press than a regular bench press since it is generally easier to lift the weight.

Step 1

Lie flat on an decline exercise bench - feet secured at the high end of the bench for support. Position the weights along the sides of your chest, elbows aimed at the floor.

Step 2

Turn the weights so that your palms face forward.

Step 3

Keeping your back flat on the bench, slowly press the weights up until your arms are fully extended above your chest, elbows unlocked.

Step 4

Slowly lower the weights back down along the sides of your chest and repeat.

Take an overhand grip on the bar, slightly wider than a shoulder-width apart. Inhale and push the bar off the rack (if there is one) then move it lower down to the midline of your chest.

This exercise is similar to other bench and chest presses but the unstable nature of cables makes it a little more advanced than them. The comparative lack of stability means that there has to be more emphasis on working not just the major chest muscles but also the muscles that assist them.
