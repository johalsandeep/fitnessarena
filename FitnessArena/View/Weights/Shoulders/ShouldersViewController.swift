This is one of the most effective of all the shoulder-building exercises, and should be incorporated in workout programs of all levels once the correct movement has been mastered and feels comfortable.

Step 1

Sit with your back on a bench that allows a steep incline - between 80° and 90°. Grasp the barbell with an overhand (pronated) grip with your hands just a little wider than shoulder-width apart and rest it on your upper chest.

Step 2

Brace your shoulders and back, then inhale and press the bar straight up, keeping your elbows slightly bent at the top.

Step 3

To finish, lower back down to the start position, keeping your abdominals and lower back braced, then repeat for the desired number of reps.
""",
              //Bar upright row

This exercise works not only the shoulders but the trapezius (in the back), making it a good linking exercise between shoulders and back.

Step 1

Stand with your feet slightly wider than a shoulder-width apart and take an overhand grip on a barbell with your hands also a shoulder-width apart.

Step 2

Pull up to the level of your chin, keeping the bar close to your body and keeping your elbows higher than the bar.

Step 3

Hold for a few seconds before lowering back to the start position, ensuring that your elbows remain slightly bent and avoiding any bouncing or jerking movements.

Step 1

Stand upright and hold a barbell behind your thighs or hips with your arms extended straight down your sides.

Step 2

Pull the barbell up behind your hips and lower back as far as possible, allowing your elbows to travel up behind your body. Flex your wrists near the top of the movement so that the bar can be raise even higher. Then, lower your arms until your wrists are once again straight. Repeat.
""",
              //Barbell shrug
              """
Step 1

Grab a barbell with an overhand grip that is slightly more than a shoulder-width apart and let your arms hang straight down in front of your body. Keep your legs slightly bent.

Step 2

Shrug your shoulders by imagining trying to touch your shoulders to your ears while keeping the rest of your body steady. Pause, then reverse to the starting position.
""",
              //High pull
              """
Step 1

Stand over the barbell with the balls of the feet positioned under the bar slightly wider apart than hip width. Squat down and grip the bar with an over hand grip slightly wider than shoulder width. Position the shoulders over the bar with the back arched tightly. Arms are straight with elbows pointed along the bar.

Step 2

Pull the bar up off the floor by extending the hips and knees. As the bar reaches the knees vigorously raise the shoulders while keeping the barbell close to the thighs, jump upward extending the body. Flex elbows out to the sides, pulling bar up to neck height.

Step 3

Bend knees slightly and lower barbell to mid-thigh position. Slowly lower bar with taut lower back and trunk close to vertical. The advanced athlete may unload (drop) the bar from the completed position. This technique may be practiced to reduce the stress or fatigue involved in lowering the bar as prescribed. Use rubber weightlifting plates on a weightlifting platform if this unloading method is used (unless floor demolition is desired).

             //Cable rear lateral raise
             """
This exercise works the deltoids, in the shoulder, especially the rear head of each deltoid. At the end of the movement, when you pinch your scapulae (shoulder blades) together, you can emphasize trapezius and the rhomboids (in the back).

Step 1

Kneel down on your hands and knees side-on to the cable machine, making sure that you keep your back straight and your abdominal muscles pulled in. Reach through and grab the handle, then take up the stack on the weight stack.

Step 2

Keeping your elbow slightly bent, pull your arm back through until your upper arm is in line with your shoulder. At the same time, extend your lower arm and contract the rear of your shoulder.

Step 3

Keeping the movement under control, guide the cable back to the start position, keeping the tension on throughout, and repeat for the desired number of reps.
""",
             //Cable side lateral raise

This is an excellent exercise that isolates the medial head of the deltoids (at the side of the shoulders) almost completely. The movement is very effective and beginners and those at intermediate or advanced levels can use it as part of a shoulder workout.

Step 1

Stand close to the cable machine and side-on to it, position your arm slightly in front of your thighs and take hold of the handle.

Step 2

Inhale and, keeping a slight bend in the elbow, raise your arm out to the side of the body until your upper arm is level with your shoulder. Keep your palm facing down.

Step 3

Slowly, and with the movement under control, lower your arm back down to the start position.
""",

""",
             //Machine lateral raise
             """
This exercise isolates the medial head of the shoulder, but because its movement is fixed there is little room for error. This makes the exercise an ideal one for beginners.

Step 1

Adjust the seat height so that the center of your shoulder aligns with the machine's rotational axis.

Step 2

Keeping your back tall, brace your shoulders and life your arms to the horizontal while keeping your shoulders down. Maintain correct posture.

Step 3

Return your arms to the starting position, keeping the movement under control.
""",
             //Machine rear raise

Step 1

Sit on the machine and adjust your seat so that the handles are at shoulder level.

Step 2

Holding the handles, pull them in the motion illustrated while keeping your arms parallel to the floor. At the most posterior extension, press your shoulder blades together to get the maximum effect.

Step 3

Slowly return your arms to the starting position. Remember to keep your chest pressed across the pad throughout all motions.
""",
             //Machine shoulder press
             """
This is a very good strength exercise that can build good base level of muscle in the shoulder region. There is a fixed plan of motion, so little technical ability is needed to make the exercise effective. A great all-round shoulder exercise

Step 1

Adjust the seat height, aligning the horizontal handles with the top of your shoulders. Depress the foot level and ensure that your back is comfortably supported. Sit tall in the seat.

Step 2

Push up, extending your arms over your head in a controlled manner. Avoid any snapping or locking out of the elbows.

Step 3

Return to the start position in a controlled way and complete the remainder of your reps.
""",
             //Rotator cuff - external
             """
As with the internal rotator-cuff exercise, this exercise helps prevent injuries to the shoulder girdle, and is extremely effective. It works the external layer of rotator-cuff muscles beneath the shoulder muscles. Doing this exercise is an ideal way of finishing a shoulder workout or a rehab routine. In conjunction with the internal rotator cuff-exercise it plays an important part in the wind-up of a shoulder workout or rehab routine.

Step 1

Stand facing away from the cable machine, take up the handle, keep your forearm parallel to the floor, and fix your elbow in to the side of your body.

Step 2

Rotate your upper arm out, bring your forearm away from your body and out, away from the midline.

Step 3

Take the handle out to the side as much as possible within your own range of motion, and hold for a second before bringing it back in toward your navel.
