## Introduction

###### I started with going to miro and using a preset for brainstorming on a 1 - 8 page document. I used collaboration with other people to get feedback on my ideas and improve what I was working on.Basically, this inception phase is having everything about application like application name as a brand name and a official logo , 1-8 Pages document consists whole functioning section in the form of UML diagrams along strengths of competitors. These are the essential concerns which should be kept in mind before designing and development phase.

###### There are many ways to do exercise both at Gym and Home with or without equipment but we need a professional way to do these activities. This application is going be a convenient way for all of those who are committed to their fitness level and exercise on regular basis. This application will include exercise tutorials, details of required nutrition after workouts, weight loss and workout tips, and regular notifications. There would be forms for test of one's ability, capacity, stamina, or suitability so users can get their level of fitness. This application would get regular updates from admin side with latest and exciting features.
## Version Control
###### I am going to be using a private repository in GitHub to track all of my changes and commits while I develop this app. I am currently in the inception phase. You can visit my miro site that is running live [here](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_lwDvtnc=/).
## Inception Phase
###### I am currently in the inception phase.
###### Current phase gives us a chance to do a reality check of the intended work . It helps to plan everything like resources and blueprints for appliation.which further helps to do better at design and development stage.
