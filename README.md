# Introduction
###### I started with going to miro and using a preset for brainstorming on a 1 - 8 page document. I used collaboration with other people to get feedback on my ideas and improve what I was working on.Basically, this inception phase is having everything about application like application name as a brand name and a official logo , 1-8 Pages document consists whole functioning section in the form of UML diagrams along strengths of competitors. These are the essential concerns which should be kept in mind before designing and development phase.
